# SCTP Associate Data Analyst Capstone Project Requirements

## Scenario:
Assume you are a Data Analyst at a company that provides data analytics, visualization, and consulting services to a diverse clientele across various industries. Your role involves developing data-driven solutions tailored to clients' unique needs and challenges.

## Project Selection:
Begin by selecting a project and envisioning a realistic client scenario in an industry of your choice.

Examples of potential clients could include:
- A healthcare provider seeking to improve patient outcomes
- A retail company aiming to optimize inventory
- A financial institution working to enhance fraud detection
- Or any other problem in any other field you prefer

Once you have chosen a project, source one or more datasets relevant to the client's industry and objectives. The dataset(s) can be from open data sources, industry-specific databases, or any other source available to you. NO SYNTHETIC, ARTIFICIAL OR GENERATED DATA IS ALLOWED. Ensure the data has adequate scope and detail to support meaningful analysis.

## Project Objective:
Your task is to develop a data analysis pipeline that adds value to the client’s operations. This involves creating an end-to-end solution, from data preparation to visualization, to effectively address the client’s challenges.

## Project Requirements:

1. Data Understanding and Solution Identification:
Thoroughly analyze the dataset(s) to identify insights and potential business intelligence (BI) or analytical solutions that align with the client’s needs.

2. Data Preparation:
Perform data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the dataset(s) are ready for analysis.

3. Pipeline Development:
Design and implement a BI or analytical pipeline solution using the cleaned and processed data.

4. Performance Evaluation:
Assess the solution’s performance with relevant metrics, ensuring it meets quality standards for the client.

5. Data Visualization:
Create charts and graphs that effectively communicate the results of your analysis.

6. Documentation and Recommendations:
Summarize your findings and provide clear recommendations based on your analysis.

## Available Tools:
You are encouraged to use the following tools for this project. If you need additional tools, consult with your trainer.
- Python 3 (with libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory
- Power BI Desktop/Service
- Microsoft Excel
- SQL of any dialect

## Submission Guidelines:

1. Dataset Requirements:
Your project should integrate at least two datasets or a single, substantial dataset (approximately 1,000 records). The data should be processed to ensure it is clean, normalized, and ready for analysis.

2. Data Exploration and Analysis:
Use Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) to perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA). Document key insights, including:
-- Articulate the size and shape of the dataset.
-- Comment on data quality with respect to null values or missing data.
-- Describe the data types of all features.
-- Select a target column for analysis.
-- Provide descriptive statistics and information for the entire dataset.
-- Identify and comment on outliers within the dataset.
-- Create plots for each categorical column, showing categorical feature distributions.
-- Generate appropriate charts for numerical features, both individually and in relation to the target column.
-- Calculate and display correlations between numerical features and the target feature.
-- Identify any other significant relationships or patterns within the data.
-- Summarize findings from these EDA steps, highlighting key insights and implications for the project.

3. Visual Exploration:
Based on the project’s objectives, create at least five visualizations using Python or Power BI. Explain your choice of visualization type and tool for each.

4. Model Development:
Build a model suited to the project’s needs and evaluate its performance using at least three metrics appropriate to regression or classification (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, R²). If certain metrics are solely ideal, it is expected that this will be mentioned by the candidate, but still 3 metrics total must be presented, even if the remaining 2 are sub-optimal or not ideally suited for the task. If the learners can draw an invidious distinction [An invidious distinction is a difference between two things that is unfair, offensive, or likely to cause unhappiness] between the ideal metric and the others, they are encouraged to do so.

5. Report Presentation:
Prepare a report in either Power BI (with at least three pages and a summary dashboard) or Jupyter Notebook (with at least five graphics and 300 words of markdown text). Present the data insights in a storytelling format that is tailored to the target audience. IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO USE PRESENTATION OR SLIDESHARING SOFTWARE FOR THIS SECTION, but you may if you prefer. Presentation will be 10 to 12 minutes with 5 minutes of question & answer after.

Note: If the minimum criteria above are not met, the project will be deemed incomplete, and you will not pass the assessment.
