# NTUC LearningHub SkillsFuture Career Transition Programmes (SCTP) Associate Data Analyst: Capstone Project

## Heart Disease Prediction

Last Updated On 25th November 2024.

## Objective

To develop a robust binary classification machine learning model with multiple numerical and categorical features that can accurately predict the likelihood of adverse heart disease outcomes, based on a comprehensive set of patient health indicators. The model will be used to predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease depending on multiple attributes, as early and accurate prediction of heart disease outcomes can significantly improve patient care and survival rates.

## Dataset

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:
- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
- **Total: 1190 observations**
- *Duplicated: 272 observations*
- `Final dataset: 918 observations`

Every dataset used can be found from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link:

## Decision Tree Classification
Hyperparameters Used For Decision Tree Classification:
- **max_depth=4** : The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples.
- **min_samples_leaf=1** : The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node, with default=1. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
- **random_state=7** : Controls the randomness of the estimator.

## Conclusion

- 5 different classification models are trained with this dataset and all have accuracies over 80%.
- Using these models (namely Decision Tree Classification with accuracy of 87%), doctors or nurses at the hospital will be better able to assess the risk of heart disease using non-invasive techniques. Therefore, they will be able to provide a patient with the appropriate next course of actions if a risk of heart disease is predicted.
- It is clear that some features (like "ST_Slope", "Oldpeak", "ChestPainType") are more important to predict the risk of heart disease than others (like "RestingECG", "RestingBP", "Age", "FastingBS").

## Future Investigations

- The issue of "Cholesterol" feature being bimodal distribution is not fully address and we can use [binning transformation](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-do-you-transform-skewed-bimodal-data-set-normal) by grouping it into categories based on a certain criterion, instead of removal of the feature. However, this needs to be investigated further than just applying binning transformation as the machine learning models might be trained to predict that "Cholesterol=0" means have Heart Disease.

- The current dataset does not have data from Asian individuals and it would be [critical](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23051-ethnicity-and-heart-disease) to carry out similar modeling technique for such a dataset.
- The current dataset does not have some features that we know risk factors for CVDs like lifestyle factors (smoking, unhealthy diet, low physical activity, alcohol use), weight, family history, diabetes, and other environmental factors. The [UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) does have some of the features but there are too many missing values within those features.
- Hyperparameter tuning was not done for modeling and it usually can improve the performance of the algorithms. Nevertheless, the current performance of the models above are good.
- Outliers were not removed even though, based on the boxplots, there are some outliers but this will require more investigation on how the data is collected and better understand of the features.
