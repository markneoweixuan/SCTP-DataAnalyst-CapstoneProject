Data Science Project Presentation Checklist

1. Project Selection and Dataset Requirements
- Is the dataset a minimum of 1,000 records or does it integrate multiple datasets with adequate scope and detail?
- Is all the data real, not artificial or synthetic?
- Does the dataset provide a meaningful basis for analysis aligned with the client's industry and objectives?
- Did you clearly identify your role and articulate the scenario for the use of the dataset, as well as the goal of the analysis?
---
2. Data Understanding and Preparation
- Have you analyzed the dataset(s) to identify insights and potential business intelligence (BI) or analytical solutions?
- Have you performed data cleaning, including handling null values, missing data, and inconsistencies?
- Have you normalized and transformed the data to ensure it is ready for analysis?
---
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Have you articulated the size and shape of the dataset?
- Have you assessed data quality, including null values or missing data?
- Have you documented the data types of all features?
- Have you selected a target column for analysis?
- Have you provided descriptive statistics for the dataset?
- Have you identified and commented on outliers within the dataset?
- Have you created plots for each categorical column to show feature distributions?
- Have you generated appropriate charts for numerical features, both individually and in relation to the target column?
- Have you calculated and displayed correlations between numerical features and the target column?
- Have you summarized key insights and implications from the EDA process?
--- 
4. Data Visualization
- Have you created at least five visualizations relevant to the project objectives?
- Have you used Python libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) or Power BI to develop visualizations?
- Have you explained the choice of visualization type and tool for each?
---
5. Analytical Pipeline Development
- Have you designed and implemented an analytical or BI pipeline to address the client’s challenges using cleaned and processed data?
---
6. Model Development and Performance Evaluation
- Have you built a model suited to the project’s needs (e.g., regression, classification)?
- Have you employed at least 3 metrics appropriate to either a classification or a regression task (as appropriate to your situation)?
- Have you mentioned if certain metrics are sub-optimal but required?
- Have you explained why the chosen metric(s) are ideal for the project and drawn distinctions if applicable?
---
7. Documentation and Recommendations
- Have you summarized findings from the analysis and EDA process?
- Have you provided clear, actionable recommendations tailored to the client’s needs?
---
8. Material Preparation
- Have you prepared your project materials in one of the following formats:
-- Power BI: At least three pages, including a summary dashboard.
-- Jupyter Notebook: At least five graphics and 300 words of markdown text.
- Have you presented the data insights in a storytelling format tailored to the target audience?
- Have you optionally used presentation or slide-sharing software if preferred?
---
9. Submission Guidelines
- Have you ensured all minimum criteria are met to avoid an incomplete assessment?
- Have you double-checked that:
-- Dataset(s) meet the size and quality requirements.
-- All EDA, visualizations, and models are documented clearly.
-- The report aligns with storytelling and client-focused objectives?
---
10. Tools and Resources
- Have you used any combination of the following tools:
-- Python 3 (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, plotly)
-- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory
-- Power BI Desktop/Service
-- Microsoft Excel
-- SQL (any dialect)?
- Have you consulted with the trainer if additional tools are needed?
---
11. Report Preparation
- Have you drafted and scripted a 10-12 minute report on your findings?
-- Have you rehearsed and timed it?
-- And re-rehearsed it?
-- Are you prepared to receive questions about the report?
-- Did you include a significant section regarding challenges you encountered and new material you learned or discovered?
-- Have you mentioned what you would do with additional time or resources?
-- Do you have your project repo up on Github with a full README.md including screenshots and writeup and did you link from Github to your LinkedIn in the README.md?
