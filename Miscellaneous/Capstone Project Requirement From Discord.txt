Scenario:
Assume you are a Data Analyst at a company that provides data analytics, visualization, and consulting services to a diverse clientele across various industries. Your role involves developing data-driven solutions tailored to clients' unique needs and challenges.

Project Selection:
Begin by selecting a project and envisioning a realistic client scenario in an industry of your choice.

Examples of potential clients could include:
-- A healthcare provider seeking to improve patient outcomes
-- A retail company aiming to optimize inventory
-- A financial institution working to enhance fraud detection
-- Or any other problem in any other field you prefer

Once you have chosen a project, source one or more datasets relevant to the client's industry and objectives. The dataset(s) can be from open data sources, industry-specific databases, or any other source available to you. NO SYNTHETIC, ARTIFICIAL OR GENERATED DATA IS ALLOWED. Ensure the data has adequate scope and detail to support meaningful analysis.

Project Objective:
Your task is to develop a data analysis pipeline that adds value to the client’s operations. This involves creating an end-to-end solution, from data preparation to visualization, to effectively address the client’s challenges.

Project Requirements:

1. Data Understanding and Solution Identification:
Thoroughly analyze the dataset(s) to identify insights and potential business intelligence (BI) or analytical solutions that align with the client’s needs.

2. Data Preparation:
Perform data cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure the dataset(s) are ready for analysis.

3. Pipeline Development:
Design and implement a BI or analytical pipeline solution using the cleaned and processed data.

4. Performance Evaluation:
Assess the solution’s performance with relevant metrics, ensuring it meets quality standards for the client.

5. Data Visualization:
Create charts and graphs that effectively communicate the results of your analysis.

6. Documentation and Recommendations:
Summarize your findings and provide clear recommendations based on your analysis.

Available Tools:
You are encouraged to use the following tools for this project. If you need additional tools, consult with your trainer.
-- Python 3 (with libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and plotly)
-- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory
-- Power BI Desktop/Service
-- Microsoft Excel
-- SQL of any dialect

Submission Guidelines:

1. Dataset Requirements:
Your project should integrate at least two datasets or a single, substantial dataset (approximately 1,000 records). The data should be processed to ensure it is clean, normalized, and ready for analysis.

2. Data Exploration and Analysis:
Use Python libraries (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) to perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA). Document key insights, including:
-- Articulate the size and shape of the dataset.
-- Comment on data quality with respect to null values or missing data.
-- Describe the data types of all features.
-- Select a target column for analysis.
-- Provide descriptive statistics and information for the entire dataset.
-- Identify and comment on outliers within the dataset.
-- Create plots for each categorical column, showing categorical feature distributions.
-- Generate appropriate charts for numerical features, both individually and in relation to the target column.
-- Calculate and display correlations between numerical features and the target feature.
-- Identify any other significant relationships or patterns within the data.
-- Summarize findings from these EDA steps, highlighting key insights and implications for the project.

3. Visual Exploration:
Based on the project’s objectives, create at least five visualizations using Python or Power BI. Explain your choice of visualization type and tool for each.

4. Model Development:
Build a model suited to the project’s needs and evaluate its performance using at least three metrics appropriate to regression or classification (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, R²). If certain metrics are solely ideal, it is expected that this will be mentioned by the candidate, but still 3 metrics total must be presented, even if the remaining 2 are sub-optimal or not ideally suited for the task. If the learners can draw an invidious distinction [An invidious distinction is a difference between two things that is unfair, offensive, or likely to cause unhappiness] between the ideal metric and the others, they are encouraged to do so.

5. Report Presentation:
Prepare a report in either Power BI (with at least three pages and a summary dashboard) or Jupyter Notebook (with at least five graphics and 300 words of markdown text). Present the data insights in a storytelling format that is tailored to the target audience. IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO USE PRESENTATION OR SLIDESHARING SOFTWARE FOR THIS SECTION, but you may if you prefer.

Note: If the minimum criteria above are not met, the project will be deemed incomplete, and you will not pass the assessment.
